#  ShoppingListByStore

## Initial project by Tim Causgrove

This app shows separate simple shopping lists for different stores.

## To use the app

- Tap on the store name to see a list of stores
- Tap the "+" to add a new store
- Tap on a store to set it as the current store
- Swipe left on a store to delete the store
- Pull down "List of Stores" to get back to the Shopping List
- Tap the "+" to add an item
- Tap an item to toggle the checkmark
- Tap the trash can to delete all checked items
- Long press and drag to re-arrange items
- Swipe left to delete an item regardless of check mark

The "Edit" button actually does the same thing as long-tap and drag or swipe left, but some users may find it more intuitive to use the button.

Enjoy!
